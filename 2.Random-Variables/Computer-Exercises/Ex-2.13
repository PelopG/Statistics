Let X âˆ¼ N(0, 1) and let Y = e^X.
(a) Find the pdf for Y . Plot it.
(b) (Computer Experiment.) Generate a vector x = (x1, . . . , x10,000) consisting of 10,000 random standard Normals. 
Let y = (y1, . . . , y10,000)
where yi = e^xi . 
Draw a histogram of y and compare it to the pdf you found in part (a).
