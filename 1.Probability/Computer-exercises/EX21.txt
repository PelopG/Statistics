EXERCISE 21: (Computer Experiment.) 

Suppose a coin has probability p of falling heads up. If we flip the coin many times, we would expect the proportion of
heads to be near p. We will make this formal later. Take p = .3 and n = 1, 000 and simulate n coin flips. 
Plot the proportion of heads as a function of n. 
Repeat for p = .03.
