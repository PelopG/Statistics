EXERCISE 22: (Computer Experiment.)

Suppose we flip a coin n times and let p denote the probability of heads. Let X be the number of heads. 
We call X a binomial random variable, which is discussed in the next chapter.
Intuition suggests that X will be close to np. 
To see if this is true, we can repeat this experiment many times and average the X values. 
Carry out a simulation and compare the average of the Xâ€™s to np. 
Try this for p = .3 and n = 10, n = 100, and n = 1, 000.
